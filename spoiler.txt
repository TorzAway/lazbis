Clue - 6 day lockout

Head to Plane of Mischief (mischiefplane) and speak to Clue to obtain the instance.

When you zone in, speak to Elias for some background on the task. Like the game Clue, you must identify the Who, What and Where of the murder of Tserrina.

Say 'where' to Elias for the list of floors and select any floor to begin. Elias will port you between each floor.

Hail each of the 6 suspects. One will emote one of the following lines:
- The Librarian glances around anxiously, hands fidgeting.
- Angry Chef slams a fist on the table, eyes narrowing with irritation rather than remorse.
- Ahhotep smirks slightly, his eyes gleaming with a hint of something... unsettling.
- Daman the Bride glares with a manic intensity, her eyes blazing with fury.
- Disordered Spirit says 'No... It wasn't me... was it? I don't... remember. Shadows... they hide so much...
- Svartmane The Advisor smiles slightly, his eyes calculating and calm.

Whichever one outputs the emote is the killer.

Say 'What' to each suspect. Upon saying 'What', either a mob or ground spawn will spawn somewhere in the zone.
If an item spawns, then go pick it up and it will be the murder weapon.
If a mob spawns, go kill it and loot the murder weapon from its corpse. Make sure to let the mob aggro you first, or its loot table can bug.
The possible mobs are Sinister Conspirator in the library, Cloaked Confidante in the dining hall, Elusive Henchman in the Wedding Hall and Dark Associate in the Dragon Terrace.

Hail the other grey con NPCs on each floor and they will trigger a ground spawn to spawn somewhere in the zone. Find the ground spawn whose lore indicates 'Strong' evidence and this floor is the location.
The 'Strong' evidence items are:
- Tserrina's Broken Staff
- Tserrina's Burned Diary
- Tserrina's Crushed Amulet
- Tserrina's Torn Robe

Once you have all three answers, head up to Tranquility and solve the puzzle.
